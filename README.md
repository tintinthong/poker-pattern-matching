## Poker Matching Algoritm

### Description
The most difficult part of making a poker game (in whatever language) is the pattern-matching algorithm. 
Out of the combination of the total 7 cards(5 from flop, 2 from hand), how do you extract the highest scoring pattern. 

This repo does two things: 
1) Randomise 7-hand
2) Give the higest-scoring hand.

## Poker Matching Algoritm

### Description
The most difficult part of making a poker game is the pattern-matching algorithm. 
Out of the combination of the total 7 cards (5 from flop, 2 from hand), how do you extract the highest scoring pattern? 

This repository does two things:
1. Finds the highest scoring pattern obtained from 7 cards.
2. Compares two hands to account for same pattern and ties.

#### Poker Hands 

These are the patterns accounted for:

1. Royal Flush
2. Straight Flush 
3. Straight Flush (Low Ace)
4. Four of a Kind
5. Full House
6. Flush
7. Straight
8. Straight (Low Ace)
9. Three of A Kind
10. Two Pair
11. One Pair
12. High Card 

### Installation

Will be made into npm repository soon.
